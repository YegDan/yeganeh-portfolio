      <h2 className="swift-scheduler-title">SwiftScheduler: Dance Academy Scheduling Web App</h2>
      <p>September 2023 - April 2024</p>
      <p>George Brown College</p>

      
        
      <h4>SwiftScheduler was a capstone project undertaken at George Brown College during the academic year. It involved agile sprint planning and development over two semesters. The project aimed to streamline scheduling processes for a hypothetical dance academy, catering to administrators, teachers, and students.</h4>
       
      

      <section className="project-section">
        <h3>Project Description</h3>
        <p>SwiftScheduler is a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack scheduling web application. The backend consists of a monolithic server built with Express.js and MongoDB, while the frontend is a React.js client styled with Tailwind CSS. The frontend and backend are deployed separately to ensure scalability and maintainability.</p>
        <h3>Accomplishments and Challenges</h3>
        <h4>Accomplishments</h4>
         <ul>
          <li>I demonstrated a strong work ethic and took a leadership role in frontend development.</li>
          <li>I provided mentorship to our UI/UX designer, collaborating closely to align design choices with client requirements.</li>
          <li>Despite being primarily focused on frontend development, I volunteered to contribute to server-side tasks when necessary.</li>
          <li>With limited prior experience in React.js, I quickly grasped its concepts and took charge of the frontend architecture. I emphasized code reusability, effectively utilizing React's reusable components and context API to manage the application's state.</li>
          <li>I proactively learned Tailwind CSS to enhance the UI/UX of the application, ensuring a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Challenges</h4>
         <ul>
          <li>Adapting to a new technology stack and coordinating with team members who were also learning new skills required dedication and effective communication.</li>
          <li>Balancing frontend and potential backend responsibilities demanded careful time management and flexibility.</li>
          <li>Ensuring consistency in code quality and design standards across the project required continuous collaboration and feedback loops within the team.</li>

        <h3>Requirments Analysis and Design</h3>
        <p>A dance academy scheduling web app developed using the MERN stack, providing a centralized and streamlined scheduling system for students, teachers, and administrators within an academy.</p>

        <h3>Wireframes/Mockups</h3>
        <p>Originally conceived as a React Native mobile app, SwiftScheduler was transformed into a web app using the MERN stack to better meet project goals. Although our initial designs reflect a mobile approach, the final implementation has been optimized for the web.</p>
